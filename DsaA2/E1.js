// Create a program that accepts the student data as input from the user. The student data should contain the following information:
// Student id
// Student name
// Student marks in 5 subjects
// Store this information in a tree data structure where each node represents a single student. The tree should be a binary search tree and use the percentage of each student as a criterion for storing objects. After storing all the information, the user will enter the name of a student and his/her grades should be displayed on the screen.
